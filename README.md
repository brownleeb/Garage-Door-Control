This is a work in progress!  I will update as I have time.  I will gladly answer specific questions, and if anyone is interested in more information on the project, I will contratate on building it out.

This is a project to control my garage doors from a web browser.  
It provides status checking as well as open/close capability.

The idea was mine, but there were many who provided the impulse.  The neat thing about these programs, IMO, is the many different ways a problem can be solved.  Mine isnt the only way, and its not the best.  I provide it in case it might become an inspiration to others, much as those projects inspired me to solve the problem my way.
